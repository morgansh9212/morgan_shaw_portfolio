### About Me
I am currently a second year Masters of Public Policy and Management Student at CMU's Heinz College. I moved to Pittsburgh in 2021 from Memphis, TN with the intent of going to medical school. For fear of not having access to enough parking, I decided to sell my car and I bought an e-bike. The e-bike showed me a completely new way of interacting with the world around me and the more I learned about transportation and the urban environment, I realized I needed a career change. So to learn the technical skills and policy chops I did not get with my BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I decided to attend Heinz. With this degree, I aim to develop the skills necessary to start a new career in Transportation policy, advocacy, and improving our built environment. 
I have already discovered a love for GIS, policy research, data wrangling and analysis. I used these skills over the summer to help [BikePGH](https://bikepgh.org/2024/08/12/many-local-justice40-communities-missing-out-on-bike-infrastructure-benefits/) tell the stories of people long neglected by our transportation system. 
When I'm not talking about biking, the bus, or walkable cities, I'm typically playing with my poodle, Louie, cooking up interesting things in the kitchen, or out exploring the city on my Brompton. 

### What I Hope To Learn
I'm hoping to learn about how to advance my GIS skills and how to use them in a professional setting. I am hoping to work in local government, which means becoming an efficient GIS project manager will help me to be effective and responsive to the often rapidly changing needs of the city.

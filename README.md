### About Me
I am currently a second year Masters of Public Policy and Management Student at CMU's Heinz College. I moved to Pittsburgh in 2021 from Memphis, TN with the intent of going to medical school. For fear of not having access to enough parking, I decided to sell my car and I bought an e-bike. The e-bike showed me a completely new way of interacting with the world around me and the more I learned about transportation and the urban environment, I realized I needed a career change. So to learn the technical skills and policy chops I did not get with my BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I decided to attend Heinz. With this degree, I aim to develop the skills necessary to start a new career in Transportation policy, advocacy, and improving our built environment. 
I have already discovered a love for GIS, policy research, data wrangling and analysis. I used these skills over the summer to help [BikePGH](https://bikepgh.org/2024/08/12/many-local-justice40-communities-missing-out-on-bike-infrastructure-benefits/) tell the stories of people long neglected by our transportation system. 
When I'm not talking about biking, the bus, or walkable cities, I'm typically playing with my poodle, Louie, cooking up interesting things in the kitchen, or out exploring the city on my Brompton. 


### What I hope to Learn
GIS is a perfect example of a tool that is so powerful, it tends to put you out ahead of your skis. If you are not careful and intentional about how you use color, imagery, and symbols, your audience might miss the important story you are trying to tell using your maps. I hope to learn all the basics of making data vizualizations that are engaging and also leave my audience understanding the story I want to tell as well as ready to take that story or knowledge and push it further. Understanding is one thing, but being inspired is another. Good data storytelling will help me as I work to reform the most dangerous city for pedestrians in the US, [Memphis, TN](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/memphis-dangerous-by-design-video/). In Memphis, the car dominates nearly all of our public space and humans have paid the price for that domination. To change the perspective of a city addicted to driving, I will need to tell the story of those people most hurt by this system. This course will show how to empathetically and effectively tell these stories.
